                  Today, the role of a school is not only to pursue the academic excellence but also to motivate and empower the students to be lifelong learners, critical thinkers, and productive members of an ever-changing global society. Converting every individual into a self-reliant and independent citizen, our school provides an amalgam of scholastic and co-scholastic activities.

                  The world today is changing at such an accelerated rate and we as educators need to pause and reflect on this entire system of Education."To Motivate the Late bloomers, To mold the Mediocre and To Challenge the Gifted” is the teaching notion. Providing good quality modern education including a strong component of cultural values, environment awareness and physical education to talented children in rural areas irrespective of their family’s socio-economic condition is the prime motto of Thaai. A committed and supportive management, dedicated teachers, caring and co-operative parents blend harmoniously to create this school as a child-centric school.

                  Education is defined as an enlightening experience; responsible for the development, growth and progression of an individual and hence mankind as a whole. It's the development occurring harmoniously in physical, psychological, social and spiritual backgrounds. It is not confinement to understanding reading and writing, but learning to differentiate right from wrong, a sense of responsibility to one's society, and reflecting one's spirit in the right direction by one's morals and values.

                  George Carlin has famously propagated, that it is not enough to teach children to read, but for them to learn to question what they read. We as teachers are responsible for shaping and channeling such ideas and curiosity.
                </p>
                

                <p id="start">
                  It is believed that young impressionable children often enter the school with a mind as a blank canvas, and the knowledge his instrument- to paint a life beautiful with a myriad of colours. But it is not only necessary to cultivate ideas, but also provide the power to construct them as reality. In this world, where failure has become part and parcel of learning, it is undoubtedly important for us to remember and teach- that mistakes are our best teachers, and should be taken as lessons in life to stand tall and competent. An amicable school environment is absolutely necessary to provide such education. As a temple of learning, we believe in making our students not only proficient for career preparation but also well- equipped to face challenges in life head-on.
